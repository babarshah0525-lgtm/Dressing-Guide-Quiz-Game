# Dressing-Guide-Quiz-Game
A Python quiz using a List of Dictionaries for dressing questions. The run_code function uses random.shuffle for variety, a robust while loop for input validation (A-D), and enumerate for question flow. The code tracks score, compares answers, and prints a final performance summary.
